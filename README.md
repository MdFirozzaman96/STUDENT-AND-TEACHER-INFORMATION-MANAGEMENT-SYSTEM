## Technologies Used:

* **Java**: The application logic and user interface are implemented in Java.
* **Swing**: Swing is used for building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
* **MySQL**: The MySQL database is used to store and manage student records.
* **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity): JDBC is used to connect Java application with the MySQL database.

## Prerequisites:

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* MySQL database server
* MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver for MySQL)

## Usage:

1. Run the application from your IDE.
2. The application's GUI will appear.
3. Log in by username(firoz96) and password(130).
4. After logged in you can navigate student or teacher management to perform operations.

## Future Works :
